# Hi, I’m Paul Stefko (@ham2anv)!
I'm a tabletop game designer and writer who also loves technology and is always looking for ways to use tech to make games better.

I write a blog called [Coding Character Sheets](https://www.nothingventuredgames.com/coding) that teaches web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
with an eye toward using them to publish analog games in a more accessible and interactive way. The posts and code from CCS is available in its own repo at 
https://github.com/ham2anv/coding-character-sheets.

You can find me on Twitter [@PaulStefko](https://twitter.com/PaulStefko), and you can check out my games at https://nvg.itch.io or 
[DriveThruRPG](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse/pub/4964/Nothing-Ventured-Games). My web site, with personal blog and more about my games, is at
https://www.nothingventuredgames.com.
